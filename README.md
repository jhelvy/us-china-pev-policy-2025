This repository contains the raw data and replication code to create the charts used in the manuscript I authored titled:

"How collaboration with China can revitalize American automotive innovation"

The key figures are:

- `figs/annual-sales.png`
- `figs/range-price-us-china-class-2024-labels-edit.png`

The first is reproduced by running the script `fig-annual-sales.R`

The second is reproduced by running the script `fig-range-price.R`. For this one, the script generates two files:

- `figs/range-price-us-china-class-2024-labels.png`
- `figs/range-price-us-china-class-2024-labels.pdf`

Since the labeled data points have poor placement in these, a hand-edited final version is created as `figs/range-price-us-china-class-2024-labels-edit.png`

Detailed descriptions of the data sources can be found in the [README file](https://github.com/jhelvy/us-china-pev-policy-2025/blob/main/data/README.md) in the "data" folder.
